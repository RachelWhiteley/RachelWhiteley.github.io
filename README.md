I created a website for skills I'm currently learning or plan to learn that could help further my career and general abilities. I'm planning on adding content as I gain skills. So its going to also eventually be a portfolio for the various skills. Currently I have used CSS Flexbox to make it responsive, the most significant change between screen sizes is that the navigations switches from vertically stacked in a column on mobile to a horizontal row in larger screens. Since I'm planning on adding skills I left the sections labelled as skilla, skillb, etc. with the ability to change them in Javascript, so that I can change the easier and also potentially use them on different pages as I build me site. I also hosted my site on Github pages which enabled me to run the Lighthouse accessiblity test. I scored 94% for mobile and 99% for desktop.
