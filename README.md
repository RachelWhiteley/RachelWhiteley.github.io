I created a website for skills I'm currently learning or plan to learn that could help further my career and general abilities. I'm planning on adding content as I gain skills. So its going to also eventually be a portfolio for the various skills.   

My CSS Feature: I used Flexbox to switch between a single column layout on mobile and smaller screens to a two-column layout on a desktop. Specifically the navigation switches from vertically stacked in a column on mobile to a horizontal row in larger screens and then the body switches between one column in mobile and smaller screens to two column in large screens.

My JavaScript Feature: I created 3 variables (var, const, or let), set their values in JavaScript, and display the values somewhere on your page. Since I'm planning on adding skills I left the sections labeled as "skilla," "skillb," etc. with the ability to change them in Javascript, so that I can change the easier and also potentially use them on different pages as I build me site. NOTE!!! The Javascript works on the local files, but I can't figure out how to get it to work in Github pages. 

My Additional Feature is from the CSS Feature List: I perform a Web Accessibility Compliance review with Lighthouse. I hosted my site on Github pages which enabled me to run the Lighthouse test in Chrome Developer tools. I scored 97% for Performance, 94% for Accessibility, 92% for Best Practices. I've included some screenshots in my images folder from this test.
