I created a website for skills I'm currently learning or plan to learn that could help further my career and general abilities. I'm planning on adding content as I gain skills. So its going to also eventually be a portfolio for the various skills. Currently I have used CSS Flexbox to make it responsive and media queries to make changes between screen sizes, specifically the navigations switches from vertically stacked in a column on mobile to a horizontal row in larger screens and then the body switches between one column in mobile and some medium smaller screens to two column in large screens. Since I'm planning on adding skills I left the sections labelled as skilla, skillb, etc. with the ability to change them in Javascript, so that I can change the easier and also potentially use them on different pages as I build me site. The Javascript works on the local files, but I can't figure out how to get it to work in Github pages. I also hosted my site on Github pages which enabled me to run the Lighthouse test in Chrome Developer tools. I scored 97% for Performance, 94% for Accessibility, 92% for Best Practices. I've included some screenshots in my images folder from this test.
